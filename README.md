# Noise-Removal-From-Image-Project

This would be a generalization of multilabel classification where each label can be multiclass (i.e., it can have more than two possible values).

Here we'll build a system that removes noise from images. It will take as input a noisy digit image, and it will output a clean digit image, represented as an array of pixel intensities, just like the MNIST images.

Notice that the classifierâ€™s output is multilabel (one label per pixel) and each label can have multiple values (pixel intensity ranges from 0 to 255). It is thus an example of a multioutput classification system.
